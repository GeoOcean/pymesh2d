## `pymesh2D: Delaunay-based mesh generation in Python`

`pymesh2D` is a `Python`-based unstructured mesh-generator for two-dimensional polygonal geometries, providing a range of relatively simple, yet effective two-dimensional meshing algorithms. `pymesh2D` includes variations on the "classical" Delaunay refinement technique, a new "Frontal"-Delaunay refinement scheme, a non-linear mesh optimisation method, and auxiliary mesh and geometry pre- and post-processing facilities.
